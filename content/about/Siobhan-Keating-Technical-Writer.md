    Siobh√°n Keating, Technical Writer - a brief introduction
---

I love to write and I feel my writing helps people understand technology and apply this new knowledge when using an application or system. I have 20 years' experience working in the IT sector. I include here some generic examples of my writing, to demonstrate what technical writing means to me and to describe my experience of the docs-as-code workflow.
