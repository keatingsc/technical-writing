## Structure your documentation

It is important to structure your content in an easy-to-navigate manner.   

### Navigation structure

To develop a clear visual hierarchy on your documentation website:

* Organise menus by topic
* Group similar types of content under the same menu
* Use a maximum of two levels of submenu

### Make the documentation searchable

Documentation must be searchable and information easy to find. Some recommendations include:

* Create short, unique, and accurate page titles.
* Link the order of menus to the importance of the content.
* Follow the recommendations on [Use meaningful link text](#use-meaningful-link-text) to create link text for URLs.

## Writing documentation

Organise your content in a logical order, including the following sections as a guide.

1. Getting started

Introduce your product and describe the first steps users need to complete.

2. Tutorials

Tutorials lead a reader through a series of steps to complete a defined task.

3. How-to guides

How-to guides help intermediate or experienced users to solve a real-world task using the software.

4. Videos

Short videos and screencasts can quickly demonstrate how to complete a task.

## Code samples and scripts

Code samples and downloadable scripts help users get up and running quickly.

### Add code samples

Small snippets of code help users understand a previously explained concept. Snippets can also be used to demonstrate the syntax of attributes or parameters.

### Add downloadable scripts

The sample code could also be downloadable, which is less error-prone than copying and pasting.

### Reference material

Include references to the softwareâ€™s code, functions, APIs, CLI, and parameters.

### Glossary

A glossary defines all the terms specific to your company or product.

## Writing style

Implement the company style guide consistently throughout the documentation suite. In general, follow the following guidelines to write clear and concise documentation.

### Topic-based writing

Write modular sections of content that cover a specific subject with a singular purpose, for example, a conceptual topic that provides an overview, or a procedural topic that explains how to accomplish a task.

* Write topic-based content that describes how to complete a singular task
* Group related topics
* Use the menu hierarchy to signpost and give context

### Be minimalist

Find a balance between no documentation and excessive documentation.

* Omit unnecessary words
* Use action-oriented headings (strong, clear verbs)
* Use bullet or numbered lists
* Use code snippets
* Use screenshots or a thoughtful diagram to aid understanding

### Use meaningful link text

Write effective link text to help users understand where each link leads.

* Do not paste the URL in the page - this can cause accessibility issues especially for screen readers.
* Do not use **Click here**, as this does not describe the target and negatively impacts SEO.
* Use meaningful words or phrases in the link text for URLs.

### Do not overuse tables

Use tables as quick references. Overly complex tables may be difficult to interpret, so strive for simplicity.

## Review your work

Aim to continuously improve your documentation; include doc reviews in each iteration.

### Version control

Ensure the documentation accurately reflects the functionality of the current release.

### Do not duplicate information

Duplicated content can introduce inconsistencies and increase maintenance overhead. To avoid duplicating content, consider reusing content and referencing strategies.
