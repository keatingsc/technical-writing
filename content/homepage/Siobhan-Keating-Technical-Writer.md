## I am a technical writer

I love to write and I feel my writing helps people understand technology and
apply knowledge in their use of an application or system. I have 20 year's
experience working in the IT sector. I include here some generic examples of
my writing, to demonstrate what technical writing means to me and to describe
my experience of the docs-as-code workflow.
