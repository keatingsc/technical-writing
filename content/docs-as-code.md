## What is a docs-as-code workflow?

A docs-as-code workflow means applying software development processes and tools to technical documentation. As a Technical Writer (TW), you write content in plain text format using a code editor, rather than a markup language like XML and a content management system. You publish docs using a static site generator rather than a complex publishing system. TWs work with docs as developers work with code, relying on a source control system to track changes in the documentation suite. Adhering to Agile principles, as TWs manage documentation, they write, review, test, merge, build, deploy and iterate.

## What tools support the docs-as-code workflow?

The four main categories of tooling in the workflow are:

* [Source Code Editor](#source-code-editor)
* [Static Site Generator](#static-site-generator)
* [Source Control System](#source-control-system)
* [Collaboration Tool](#collaboration-tool)

### Source Code Editor

Using a source code editor, such as Atom or VS Code, documentation content is written in Markdown, see [Writing Markdown](/docs/contribution_guidelines/writing_markdown/). The editor is designed for managing multiple-document projects, you can easily work with all the relevant files for related images, content, or scripts, without interrupting the workflow. A color-coding feature  ensures both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct, and also integrates the source control system showing the version status of files.

### Static Site Generator

Static site generators (SSG) is similar to a build script which takes in data, content and templates, processes them, and outputs a folder full of all the resultant pages and assets.

### Source Control System

A source control system tracks changes in a set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. For example, **Git**, a command-line tool, is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### Collaboration Tool

Teams of developers and TWs generally contribute to **Git** projects. **GitHub** provides hosting for project repositories, access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project.  

## Why use the docs-as-code approach?

According to [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/), a docs-as-code approach gives you the following benefits:

* Writers integrate better with development teams
* Developers will often write a first draft of documentation
* You can block merging of new features if they do not include documentation, which incentivizes developers to write about features while they are fresh

[Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) is a global community of people who care about documentation. This community publishes many useful resources for TWs using or thinking of adopting the docs-as-code workflow. For example, this podcast provides some useful background on the docs-as-code approach.
