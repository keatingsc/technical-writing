        <p>##What is a Technical Writer?##</p>
<p>A Technical Writer (TW) is someone who creates, structures, and publishes relevant information for a target audience in a timely manner. A TW generally works in a specific industry sector, creating modular content to describe complex products or processes. Their role is to bridge the information gap between product developer and end-user, juggling a diverse set of tools for communication, project management, content design, and publishing.</p>
<p>A TW can come from a wide variety of backgrounds. Ideally, the TW will have some foundational qualifications pertinent to their industry sector combined with a technical writing qualification. While the value placed on specific qualifications depends on the industry they work in, a TW possesses most, if not all, of the skills below.</p>
<p>##Fundamental skills##</p>
<p>The fundamental skills of a TW include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing and editing</li>
<li>Interpersonal</li>
<li>Research</li>
</ul>
<p>###Writing###
A TW loves to write well. Good writing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>structured</li>
<li>clear</li>
<li>concise</li>
<li>correct</li>
<li>consistent in terms of style and terminology</li>
</ul>
<p>When writing, you adhere to the company Style Guide first and foremost. You consistently apply industry rules and standards for technical writing. With time, however, you develop an unwavering confidence in your own ability to write, enough to “break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.”, to quote George Orwell’s (1945) rules for writing well.</p>
<p>###Editing###</p>
<p>As Strunk &amp; White (2009) state, writers must learn to “omit unnecessary words”. Write, then edit, then revise. Make editing an intrinsic part of your own writing process, ideally editing and revising before your work is reviewed by a colleague. An example in point, Stephen King (2000) describes himself as only a &ldquo;half-decent writer&rdquo; but admits to being a good editor of his own work.</p>
<p>###Interpersonal###</p>
<p>A TW can work comfortably with a diverse team of people. Writers have good people skills and can develop professional but friendly working relationships with colleagues from different backgrounds and perspectives. Conducting interviews with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) is a significant part of the job, and a good TW can glean the requisite technical information from an SME, while simultaneously learning about typical use cases for the product in question. These empathetic skills also help the writer understand the needs of their audience, when conducting both user-needs and task-based analysis.</p>
<p>###Research###</p>
<p>A TW can efficiently identify reliable sources of data, evaluate and interpret it, then summarise information so it is meaningful for an intended audience. Researching end-user profiles is important and helps to streamline content.</p>
<p>###Time/project management###</p>
<p>TWs should be able to meet deadlines. Particularly in an Agile environment, inability to meet deadlines is not tolerated. This is an easy skill to learn from basic principles, but it requires self-discipline to implement. Luckily, the Agile environment helps cure you of any propensity to procrastinate.</p>
<p>##Skills you gain over time##</p>
<p>Some skills you acquire and hone with experience. An experienced writer develops an unwavering curiosity about the trends and technological advancements not only in their sector but in the overarching field of information design and development. Writers need to keep their skills up-to-date and they make a commitment to lifelong learning. Right now, a writer will be asking themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I use AI to remove the repetitive tasks from my role?</li>
<li>What new tool can add most value to what I&rsquo;m doing?</li>
<li>What can I do to harness the capability of machine-learning?</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional skills that you hone over time include:</p>
<ul>
<li>adaptability</li>
<li>accountability</li>
<li>resilience</li>
<li>self-confidence</li>
</ul>
